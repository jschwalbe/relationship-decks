# relationship-decks
A different way of displaying the Gottman Relationship Decks.

Original app is here https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gottman-card-decks/id1292398843

The ultimate plan with this is to use the deck files obtained from the above app's data to give the end user randomized push notifications with the questions to help better engage his/her partner. The app above does not include such an option.

Goals:
* Web interface 
* Select which card decks to use
* Select which times to send the notification
* Select from multiple notification services (i.e. Telegram/Discord/Home Assistant, whatever)
* Randomization (with repeats) vs pseudo-randomization (no repeats)

Currently the project is command-line only without pretty much any of the above goals :)
